Pakistani House Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Pakistan. It is a supervised learning model because it uses labeled data to train and make predictions.

The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle.

I used different types of graphs to visualize the data like scatter plots, line graphs, linear graphs, and heatmaps to show feature relationships and correlations.

I used three machine learning models:

Regression Model - Accuracy: 58%

Random Forest Regressor - Accuracy: 93%

XGBoost Regressor - Accuracy: 92%

Random Forest Regressor gave the best result with 93% accuracy.

Libraries used in this project:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost

The project includes saved images of graphs and prediction results. You can use this project for learning and improving house price prediction models using real-world data.
